# Club Website 

This repository contains an initial version of the **Club Website** built using **Next.js**.

The project was started with the intention of creating a full-featured website for the club. However, during development, I decided to **pause and step away from further implementation**, as I did not feel aligned or motivated to continue building it at that time.

##  Project Status

**Paused / Discontinued (for now)**

The website remains **basic and incomplete**.  
This decision was a **personal choice**, not due to technical limitations.

The codebase is kept here for:

- Learning purposes
- Possible future continuation or improvement by others
